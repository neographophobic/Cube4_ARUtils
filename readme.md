# Cube4_ARUtils

This library is a series of functions, definitions and data structures that I have found useful in assisting with creating sketches for a Freetronics 4x4x4 Cube.

It is intended to be used in conjunction with the Cube library.

To install this library, click on the "Download ZIP" link on the Github page, and then in the Arduino IDE, open a new blank sketch, then select "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library"
