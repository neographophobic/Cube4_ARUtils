# Cube4_ARUtils

This library is a series of functions, definitions and data structures that I have found useful in assisting with creating sketches for a [Freetronics 4x4x4 Cube](http://www.freetronics.com.au/collections/kits/products/cube4-4x4x4-rgb-led-cube).

It is intended to be used in conjunction with the [Cube4 library](https://github.com/neographophobic/Cube4). It is not a replacement for this library, and both will be required for some sketches.

To install this library, click on the "Download ZIP" link on the Github page, and then in the Arduino IDE, open a new blank sketch, then select "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library".

A selection of sketches that I have created for the cube can be found at [Cube4 Sketches](https://github.com/neographophobic/Cube4-Sketches).
