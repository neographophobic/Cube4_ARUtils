# Cube4_ARUtils

This library is a series of functions, definitions and data structures that I have found useful in assisting with creating sketches for a [Freetronics 4x4x4 Cube](http://www.freetronics.com.au/collections/kits/products/cube4-4x4x4-rgb-led-cube).

It is intended to be used in conjunction with the [Cube4 library](https://github.com/neographophobic/Cube4). It is not a replacement for this library, and both will be required for some sketches.

A selection of sketches that I have created for the cube can be found at [Cube4 Sketches](https://github.com/neographophobic/Cube4-Sketches).

## Installation
### Step 1: Download
* To get the latest released version, goto the [Releases](https://github.com/neographophobic/Cube4_ARUtils/releases) page, and then click the "Source Code (zip)" link for the latest release.

* To get the latest development version, click on the "Download ZIP" button on the Github page for this [library](https://github.com/neographophobic/Cube4_ARUtils). If you are unsure which version to get, get the one from the "Releases" page as it is the latest stable release.

### Step 3: Rename
Rename the newly unzipped folder to "Cube4_ARUtils".

### Step 4: Move to "Arduino" -> "libraries" folder
Browse to your "Documents" folder, and within it there should be an "Arduino" folder. Open the "Arduino" folder, and if there isn't a "libraries" folder create one. Now move the renamed folder from step 3, into the "libraries" folder.

If you are unsure as to where your "Arduino"folder is, you can find it from the Arduino IDE by going "Arduino" -> "Preferences" on a Mac, and "File" -> "Preferences" on a Windows PC, and note the "Sketchbook location".
